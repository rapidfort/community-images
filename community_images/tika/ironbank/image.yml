usage_instructions: |
  $ docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:9998:9998 rapidfort/tika-ib

  # It is recommended to bind the server to localhost because Docker alters iptables and may expose your tika-server to the internet. If you are confident that your tika-server is on an isolated network you can simply run:
  $ docker run -d -p 9998:9998 rapidfort/tika-ib
what_is_text: |
  The Apache Tika toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). All of these file types can be parsed through a single interface, making Tika useful for search engine indexing, content analysis, translation, and much more.
