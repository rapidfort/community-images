usage_instructions: |
  ## Prerequisites:
  - Ensure you have a running Kubernetes cluster
  - Ensure you have the necessary CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) applied in your Kubernetes cluster.

  ## Running the Ansible Operator with Docker:

  The Ansible Operator runs as a container and requires access to a Kubernetes cluster to manage custom resources.
  $ docker run -d -v $HOME/.kube:/root/.kube:ro -v /path/to/watches.yml:/opt/ansible/watches.yml:ro rapidfort/ansible-operator-ib

  After running the operator, apply the necessary CRDs in your Kubernetes cluster
  $ kubectl apply -f /path/to/crd.yml

  Once the CRD is applied, create custom resources for the Ansible Operator to manage
  $ kubectl apply -f /path/to/cr.yml
what_is_text: |
  Ansible-Operator allows you to manage Kubernetes resources by running Ansible playbooks, providing a simplified way to automate Kubernetes operations using Ansible.
