what_is_text: |
  Open Policy Agent (OPA) is a general-purpose policy engine that enables policy-based control across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets you specify policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software. You can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more.
