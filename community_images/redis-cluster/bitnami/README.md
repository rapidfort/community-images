# RapidFort hardened image for Redis™ Cluster

RapidFort’s container optimization process hardened this Redis™ Cluster container. This container is free to use and has no license limitations.

It is the same as the [bitnami/redis-cluster][source-image-dh-link] image but more secure.

Every day, we optimize and harden a variety of Docker Hub’s most famous images. Check out our [entire library](https://hub.docker.com/u/rapidfort) of secured containers.

## Vulnerabilities: Original vs. Hardened

[![CVE Reduction][cve-reduction-link]][rf-link]

## What is Redis™ Cluster?

> Redis™ is an open-source, networked, in-memory, key-value data store with optional durability. It is written in ANSI C. The development of Redis is sponsored by Redis Labs today; before that, it was sponsored by Pivotal and VMware. According to the monthly ranking by DB-Engines.com, Redis is the most popular key-value store. The name Redis means REmote DIctionary Server.

## How do I use this hardened Redis™ Cluster image?

The runtime instructions for this container are no different from the official release. Follow the instructions in their readme, but use our hardened image.

```sh
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

# install redis-cluster, just replace repository with RapidFort registry
$ helm install my-redis-cluster bitnami/redis-cluster --set image.repository=rapidfort/redis-cluster

```

## What is a hardened image?

A hardened image is a copy of a container that has been optimized and reduced for significantly improved security. Because every container uses many open-source software components and their dependencies, there’s a lot of extra weight that can be trimmed.

This image is a hardened version of the official [bitnami/redis-cluster][source-image-dh-link] image on Docker Hub.

RapidFort is an industry-leading container optimization solution that minimizes software attack surfaces by removing unused code. Most containers can be reduced by at least 50%, which reduces the opportunity for malicious attacks and CVE exploits. Learn more at [RapidFort.com][rf-link].

Our hardened images are updated daily using the latest vulnerability information available.


## What’s the difference between the official [bitnami/redis-cluster][source-image-dh-link] image and this hardened image?
RapidFort’s hardened [rapidfort/redis-cluster][rf-dh-image-link] image has been optimized by our proprietary scanning and slimming technology. We are big fans of open-source software, containerized infrastructure, and security.

We are making secure copies of the images we use every day and the most popular ones on Docker Hub. We want to make the world a safer place to operate.
